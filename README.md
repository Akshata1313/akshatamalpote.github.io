## About Me

After 4+ years of professional experience in the insurance and adhesive industries, I decided to pivot my career into data analytics -- a field that will align with my research and analytical skills.

In my past roles:
- As a **Sales Executive at ICICI Lombard**, I gained strong communication and client-handling skills, dealing with complex insurance claims,customer escalation and queries.
- As a **Trainee Chemist at Pidilite Industries**, I learned the importance of precision, analysis, and documentation in a production environment.

 I took approximately 3-years **career break for marriage, relocation, and parenting**, and now I am **fully committed to restart my career in data analysis**.
